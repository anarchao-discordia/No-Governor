\emph{Letters from Readers}\\

\noindent \textsc{Wantagh, Long Island, New York:}\\

It reassured me, after I read Robert Shea's article in \emph{No Governor} \# 1, that the effective anarchist group doesn't consist of those proximate to you in space or convenience of access, but those proximate in purpose, energy and initiative. For the rest, ``\emph{all} contributions gladly accepted," especially including constructive criticism. But know thyself --- don't promise more than you \emph{know} you will deliver. Modern communications certainly ought to be able to help the active ones coordinate.

\noindent Ed Note: We received a very long letter from Joffre Stewart which we're saving for the next issue. We'd like to receive and print more letters from readers.
