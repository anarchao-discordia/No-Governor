\chapter{Ode to Amazon Nation}
\chapterauthor{Arlene Meyers}

\begin{verbatim}
My mother was an Amazon
my daddy was a whore
I am a liberated woman
I don't struggle anymore

Mama fought the System
and confronted Daddy's power
Mamma made her revolution
it was her finest hour

Mom and Dad are old and tired now
living with memories
I spend my time in barrooms now
drinking gin and herbal teas

Amazon Nation has triumphed
and women run the show
we're politicians, cops and generals now
keeping our sisters in tow

The hand of the lady president
is the hand of a woman at war
the sex of the hand on the trigger
functions the same as before

          *         *
          
Oh sisters, what have we done
in asserting our womanly might?
we've castrated old Father Wrong
and deified good Mother Right

We looked for simple answers
avoiding struggle along with pain
not learning the lessons of his-tory
Sisters, we've lost again

          *         *

False consciousness divides us
and women on power trips
fragmented lives and egos
the fabric of sisterhood rips

Opportunists lust for power
others grab token reform
confused, we avoid the conflict
Sisterhood dies being born

The rule of State is Force and Fraud
theft and murder bloody its hand
the revolution founders in crisis
Sisters, where do we stand?

We need a woman's revolution
but change must begin in our heads
to mend our ravaged selfhood
with strong and vital new threads

All Power to the People
does not mean power to the few
let's cast our vanguards and dogma
and begin to struggle anew
