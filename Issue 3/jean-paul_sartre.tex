\chapter{Out of the Closet with Jean-Paul Sartre}

The following is an excerpt from an interview with Jean-Paul Sartre by Michel Contat. The interview was first published in \emph{The New York Review} of August 7, 1975.\\

\noindent Q. After May 1968 you said to me: ``If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed profoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist."\\

\noindent Sartre: That is very true. And it will be evident in the television broadcasts I ma preparing. Still, I have changed in the sense that I was an anarchist without knowing it when I wrote \emph{La Nausee}: I did not realize that I was writing there could have an anarchist interpretation; I was only the relation with the metaphysical idea of ``nausea," the metaphysical idea of existence. Then, by way of philosophy, I discovered the anarchist being in me. But when I discovered it I did not call it that, because today's anarchy no longer has anything to do with the anarchy of 1890.\\

\noindent Q. Actually, you never identified yourself with the so-called anarchist movement?\\

\noindent Sartre: Never. On the contrary, I was very far from it. But I have never accepted any power over me, and I have always thought that anarchy, which is to say a society without powers, must be brought about.
