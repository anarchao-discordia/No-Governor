\chapter{The First Anarchist (poem)}
\chapterauthor{Kerry Thornley}

\begin{verbatim}
out on a limb
out on a limb
with jerusalem slim
     jerusalem slim
lest ye be perfect
gentle and wise
passing no judgements
on those other guys

yet scorning the hypocrite
and the letter of law
and clearing the temple
like you never saw

down with the high priest
out with the prigs
and woe to ye vipers
ye capitalist pigs

the time is now coming
the time is now near
the time has not ever
been elsewhere than here



and no greater love has any than this
to lay down your life in return for a kiss
to live it for others and die it the same
to cast off your bushel and lift up your flame

nailed to a limb
nailed to a limb
o jerusalem slim
  jerusalem slim
you are the brother
who launched the great struggle
with words they now twist
and verses they juggle
\end{verbatim}
