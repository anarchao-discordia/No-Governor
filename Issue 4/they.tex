\begin{verbatim}
If we refuse to pay their taxes
  they throw our ass in jail,
if we resist their crazy war-machine
  they say that we've turned tail,
and if we manage to stay free awhile
  they make out we're out on bail.
               They own everything.
If we try to build a better life
  they scheme to block our plan,
if we want to free the women
  they soon champion the man,
and when we challenge their new doomsday plot
  it's our protest that they ban.
               They'll do anything.
If we let them run right over us
  they may set the world aflame
and as we roast among the ruins
  it is us that they will blame.
I don't suppose it's any different,
  they've always been the same.
               I wonder why.
If we can find out who they are
  perhaps we'll find a way to change,
if we can zero in upon them,
  if we can only get their range,
we might go on without them.
  Now wouldn't that be strange?
               It's worth a try.
